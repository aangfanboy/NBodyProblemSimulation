# N Body Problem Simulation With OpenGL & CUDA

This project aims to simulate the well known N Body problem in physics. Code skeleton will be written in Python. After successful simulation of 2 body problem, code will be migrated to C++, then the calculations will be made with CUDA.


## To-Do

- [x] Create the 3D Environment
- [ ] Add Newtonian Coordinate Map to the Main Screen
- [ ] Finalize time discretization process
- [ ] Finalize the simulation for 2 body problem, share results with different initial momentum
- [ ] Migrate the Code to C++ and repeat the results
- [ ] Solve the same 2 body calculations with CUDA (benchmark ?)
- [ ] Solve the N body problem with CUDA's parallel computing
